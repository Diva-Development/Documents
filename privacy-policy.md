# Privacy Policy for Diva - The Discord Music Bot

**Last Updated**: 19 April 2025

## Introduction

Thank you for choosing **Diva**, your go-to Discord music bot! We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you interact with Diva.

By using Diva, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please refrain from using the bot.

## 1. Information We Collect

Diva is designed to provide high-quality audio streaming across various platforms. To offer these services, Diva may collect and process the following types of information:

- **Discord User Data**: We may collect basic user information provided by Discord, such as your username, user ID, server information, and any commands you input while interacting with Diva.
  
- **Interaction Data**: We track how you interact with Diva, including the commands you use (e.g., play, skip, pause, etc.) and the servers where Diva is used.

- **Audio Data**: Diva processes audio data for streaming purposes. However, Diva does not store or retain any music tracks or recordings. The audio data is processed in real-time and is only temporarily handled for playback.

- **Platform Data**: If you use platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Deezer, Twitch, Vimeo, or HTTP-based radio streams to play music, Diva interacts with these services to fetch and stream content. Diva does not collect your login credentials for any of these services, but it may record interaction history with these services (such as the song titles, URLs, or streams being played).

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and improve the functionality of Diva.
- Personalize your experience by remembering your preferences and settings.
- Analyze bot usage to enhance the service.
- Ensure that Diva operates smoothly, with minimal lag and downtime.
  
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.

## 3. Data Retention

Diva does not store your personal data permanently. All interaction data is processed temporarily for the duration of your session and is deleted once the session ends. This includes any music playback history. We do not store any audio content played by the bot.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Diva interacts with third-party services (such as YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, and others) to fetch content for playback. These services have their own privacy policies, which you should review separately. Diva does not share your personal data with these third-party services, but we may collect interaction data related to content requests and streaming.

## 5. Security

We take the security of your data seriously and implement appropriate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Diva is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.

## 7. Your Rights

As a user of Diva, you have the right to:

- Access the data we have about you.
- Request that we delete your interaction history or other personal data (subject to limitations related to security and legal obligations).
- Opt out of specific data processing by refraining from using certain features.
